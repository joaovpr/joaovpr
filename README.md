# Hi there, my name is João 👋

I am currently immersed in the world of QA and Testing. I graduated in Computer Science from the Federal University of Campina Grande. Although my previous experience was mainly focused on frontend development, I am currently exploring the fascinating world of software quality assurance.

My main activities involve participation in the entire testing flow on a variety of software projects. This includes everything from modeling to test development, execution, and evaluation, as well as the analysis of quality metrics. I believe that the quality of a product is fundamental to success, and my role is to ensure that systems meet the highest standards.
